<h1> Yanet Fernandez Zamora </h1>

I am an undergraduate student researcher at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh (UWO), majoring in Mathematics with a Statistics emphasis, Spanish and Computer Programming Certificates, and a concentration in Sociology. 

This summer I was fortunate enough to be accepted in to the McNair Scholar Program at UWO to conduct computational sociology research with my McNair mentor, Dr. Jeremiah Bohr.

I am interested in pursuing graduate school and a career in data science with a focus on social science applications and quantitative methods. Perhaps even teach one day at a university where I can help other underrepresented students find a passion in STEM, and hopefully see the beautiful artistry that data science research can be.
